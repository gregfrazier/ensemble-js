Assemble DOM elements w/ templates

Just a work-in-progress javascript "library" that I'm using to help with dynamically creating DOM elements in a Cordova app I'm working on.

The app is scriptable and I wanted a really quick way to generate stuff either on the fly or with templates and I wanted it to be light-weight.

Needs a lot of work.
